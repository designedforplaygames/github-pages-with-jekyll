First play-test of Danny Amoeba&trade; at Paramecium High went .. better than I expected.  A lot of changes are needed, but some of the core mechanics are good.

Since the playtest, I've redesigned the event and dance system, reworked the action cards and summer vacation cards, re-tuned the scoring, and tweaked the rulebook all over the place.  Hopefully I'll be able to arrange another playtest soon.
